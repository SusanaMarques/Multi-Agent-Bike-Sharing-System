# Multi-Agent-Bike-Sharing-System
Balancing a dynamic public bike-sharing system by developing multi-agent systems with JADE and Agent UML

### Interface Agent

As a way to verify the implemented system, an Interface Agent was created whose function is to demonstrate data about the system and the simulation in real time.

As we can see, the results obtained were balanced in a dynamic system for a random period of time.
